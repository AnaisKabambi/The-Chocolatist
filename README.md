# The Chocolatist

***

This is a simple multi-page website for a fictional chocolate retail store that aims to produce hand-crafted chocolates and chocolate based confection.

## Team
***

**The Chocolatist** is the brainchild of **four** dedicated BeCoders: </br>
**- Sven** </br>
**- Shreejan**</br>
**- Anais** </br>
**- Minjie**


## Goal
***

The goal of this project was to create a fictional company and its associated website. </br>
As a team, we chose to create The Chocolatist, a chocolatier specialised in hand-crafted chocolates and confection.
